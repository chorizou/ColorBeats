# ColorBeats
A simple, easy way for you to transform your favorite song into colorful and awesome patterns! Built to recognize sound and pattern, it designs a series of patterns that map to your song (or singing) and plays it back the next time it hears it. It is also able to create beautiful, pulsing designs in real-time to a song if you choose. 

Pattern is a self-created library that contains functions for multiple different patterns and lights. All patterns are pre-coded and can be called on by passing different parameters to them. 

Using LED lights and an Arduino, my team and I built a board that lights up in different colors and patterns according to a live-feed song. Our inspiration were the christmas lights that flickered to songs at large malls and venues, but all those patterns were hard programmed into the lights and were not efficient or flexible. So we wanted to build something that allowed for quick, instant results and  weren't limited to just a few songs. We implemented this through FFT and by analyzing the frequencies and amplitudes of the largest sound source to determine beats and patterns. We also created an entire library of color patterns that could be implemented if the song was pre-processed and then played back, something we are working on as the RAM of the Arduino wasn't enough to support such large quantities of data processing.
