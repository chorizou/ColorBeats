# ColorBeats
A simple, easy way for you to transform your favorite song into colorful and awesome patterns! Built to recognize sound and pattern, it designs a series of patterns that map to your song (or singing) and plays it back the next time it hears it. It is also able to create beautiful, pulsing designs in real-time to a song if you choose. 

Pattern is a self-created library that contains functions for multiple different patterns and lights. All patterns are pre-coded and can be called on by passing different parameters to them.
